# Project 0

### Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

A basic website that will display statistics from the 
Fantasy Premier League private leagues that I am involved in.
My final project for this course will be an upgraded version of this site once
I am more adept at web development. For now this will be a basic website using
only HTML, CSS and SCSS

### index.html

    Description of site and links to the two separate types of leagues.
    Only stats for gameweek 1 are available

### classic.html + h2h.html

    Table of managers and links to their team pages

### [manager_id].html

    A table of players selected that gameweek and the points they each scored
    Manager info such as their total points and a list of which leagues they are involved in
    Total stats for team. Goals scored, yellow cards etc
    A bootsrap modal containing a list of links to other team pages can be opened by clicking
    the tab next to the league name in the manager info box
